# Mockito

Mockito is a framework you can integrate with JUnit to create testing doubles for your unit tests. We use mockito to create dummy versions of our classes so we can unit test a class that depends on the existence of another class to function. With mockito we can set up behavior for our fake dependencies that mimic their usual purpose in the class being tested.
