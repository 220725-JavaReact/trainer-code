// DAO - Data Access Object
// Design pattern for creating classes that interact with DB or some
// other data storage system
// Usually you make a DAO for each table you have in the DB
// Methods in a DAO usually cover common interactions with DB
// DAO would be a collection of methods that interact with DB

/**
 * DAO for customers.
 * Used in interacting with customers table in my db
 */
public class CustomerDAO {
    // Methods in a CustomerDAO
    // addCustomer = for adding a customer
    // search customer by email
    // search customer by id
    // get all customers
